\title{Function for approximation with the help of methods other than in FuzzyNumbers package}
\usage{
FuzzyApproximation(value, method = "ExpectedValueCore", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{Fuzzy number to approximate.}

\item{method}{The selected approximation method.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to other functions (like approximation method from the FuzzyNumbers package).}
}
\value{
The output is a fuzzy number (triangular or trapezoidal one) described by
classes from \code{FuzzyNumbers} package.
}
\description{
\code{FuzzyApproximation} approximates the given fuzzy number.
}
\details{
The function approximates the fuzzy number given by \code{value} with the method selected by
\code{method}. The following approximations are possible: \code{ExpectedValueCore}--preserving the
expected value and the core of \code{value}, \code{TriangularSupportDist}--constructs the
triangular fuzzy number based on minimization of \code{DpqDistance}, preserving the support of \code{value},
and the approximation methods from the FuzzyNumbers package (namely: \code{Naive, NearestEuclidean, ExpectedIntervalPreserving,
SupportCoreRestricted}).

The input value should be given by a fuzzy number described by classes from \code{FuzzyNumbers} package.

right=function(x) 1-x^(1/4),
lower=function(alpha) qbeta(alpha,0.4,3),
upper=function(alpha) (1-alpha)^4)
